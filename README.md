# Note-Taker

## Description

This project is a simple and efficient note-taking application. 

- The motivation for this project was to create a tool that can help users keep track of a lot of information and provide quick access to their notes.
- This project was built to help users who have a need to keep track of a lot of information. It's easy to forget or be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks and other information we need to remember on a daily basis. This note-taking application allows users to have a constant, organized, and accessible place to store all this information.
- This application solves the problem of managing and organizing notes. Users can easily create, view, and delete notes, which makes managing a large amount of information easier.
- While building this project, I learned more about backend development using Node.js and Express.js. I also learned about the importance of structuring a project well and making the application's routes efficient and clean.
